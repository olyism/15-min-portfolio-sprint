## Problem

We needed to validate a new product direction with limited time and budget.

## Solution

We ran a lightweight discovery: five user interviews, a competitive audit, and a one-week prototype tested with 20 users.

## Results

- Validated the core value prop with **85%** of participants saying they would try the product.
- Pivoted one key assumption and saved the team two months of build.

## Lessons

Small, focused research beats big reports when the goal is fast alignment. We shared clips and quotes instead of a deck.
