## Problem

Teams were spending hours every week on manual activation workflows. The process was error-prone and didn't scale. We needed a way to reduce time-to-value for new customers without adding headcount.

## Solution

We designed and shipped an activation flow that guided users through key setup steps with clear progress and in-app nudges. The flow was backed by a small internal tool that could trigger lifecycle emails and track completion.

## Results

- Activation time dropped from **~4 hours** to **under 15 minutes** for typical setups.
- Support tickets related to onboarding fell by **40%** in the first quarter.
- NPS for "ease of getting started" increased by **12 points**.

## Lessons

Starting with a single "golden path" and only later adding branching kept the first version simple. We also learned that showing progress (e.g. "Step 2 of 5") mattered more than we expected for completion rates.
